# Identifying IT Assets in a Network
There are many assets related and incorporated by any multinational company for various work. This sometimes leads to tedious amount of work to monitor and manage. Although a relief is that all these assets are connected to each other via a common network which makes it easier to track. The application designed by us aims to monitor the assets employed by a company using an IP range to extract crucial details about every node in a network.

The objective of the project is to get a range of IP addresses as input from the user and then return the details of the assets having IP address falling in this range. The user can choose the machine for which they need the retrieve the information. Once selected, the application will then display all the hardware and software information about that particular machine. Next, the user can elect to logout or search for a new range, if required. This is done by taking an IP range as an input and then producing each node within this range as an output. A user can choose to view various details about any system.

The scope of this project spans any corporation employing multiple layers of assets connected in a network that they need to keep a tab on. This includes colleges, schools, start-ups and multinational corporations.
